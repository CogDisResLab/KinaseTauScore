Description: This data package provides the tau scores for each kinase 
    based on its activity in Alzheimer's disease samples.
    The data was generated by using an siRNA Library to knock down individual
    kinases and then measuring the total Tau protein Expression and the
    phopho-Tau protein expression. The resulting data wasc reposited online. 
    This package processes the resulting data to create a meaningful Tau Score 
    for each Kinase based on its activity.
