`KinaseTauScore` is a data package that allows access to a curated
dataset of phsophorylation profiles of human kinases on the ùõï-protein in
an Alzhemier Disease context. The data is derived from the paper
`High-content siRNA screening of the kinome identifies kinases involved in Alzheimer's disease-related tau hyperphosphorylation`
by Azorsa et al[^1].

## Installation

You can install the development version of KinaseTauScore like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("CogDisResLab/KinaseTauScore)
```

The Release versions are planned to be released on the
[Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org) repository. When available,
the package will be installable by running the following command:

``` r
BiocManager::install("KinaseRauScore")
```
