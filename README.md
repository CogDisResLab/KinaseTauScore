`KinaseTauScore` is a data package that allows access to a curated
dataset of phsophorylation profiles of human kinases on the ùõï-protein in
an Alzhemier Disease context. The data is derived from the paper
`High-content siRNA screening of the kinome identifies kinases involved in Alzheimer's disease-related tau hyperphosphorylation`
by Azorsa et al[^1].

## Installation instructions

Get the latest stable `R` release from
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `KinaseTauScore` from
[Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) using the following code:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("KinaseTauScore")
```

And the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/CogDisResLab/KinaseTauScore) with:

``` r
BiocManager::install("CogDisResLab/KinaseTauScore")
```

## Citation

Below is the citation output from using `citation('KinaseTauScore')` in
R. Please run this yourself to check for any updates on how to cite
**KinaseTauScore**.

``` r
print(citation('KinaseTauScore'), bibtex = TRUE)
```

Please note that the `KinaseTauScore` was only made possible thanks to
many other R and bioinformatics software authors, which are cited either
in the vignettes and/or the paper(s) describing this package.
